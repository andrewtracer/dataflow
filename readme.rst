Do we need unique node names?

* For tabular form of templates, each node in the needs to be identified.  We
could use type and index as a first pass.  Don't know if the user wants to
control the node name.  Highlighting the node while hovering on the column
(with or without dragging a filename) may work.

* When switching templates, how to keep file associations, and config values?
Without unique node names, we are forced to guess by some combination of
network structure and node position.
